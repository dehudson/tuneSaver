This is a tool for musicians to quickly save melodies that come to them while out and about using a basic in-app synthesizer on their phone that they can later access cross platform (phone/desktop). It will utilize the PWA model to deploy the app cross platform and will save the melodies to a database in C#.

<h2>Technical Summary</h2>
<ul>
 <li>C# for database</li>
 <li>Bootstrap for UI</li>
 <li>PWA Model</li>
 <li>Tone.js free framework for in browser synthesis</li>
</ul>

<h2>Feature List</h2>

 <li>Synth working in app</li>
 <li>Saving and loading tune with JSON</li>
 <li>Build database</li>
 <li>Saving and loading JSON file to database</li>
</ul>
